        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which are instances of classes. Instead of focusing only on functions and logic, OOP focuses on modeling real-world entities and their interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template used to create objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is a real instance of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Simple Definition**\n",
        "  An object represents a specific entity that:\n",
        "  * Stores data (attributes / properties)\n",
        "  * Performs actions (methods / behaviors)\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "  - Abstraction: Shows what an object does and hides how it does it.\n",
        "    * Encapsulation: Bundles data and methods together and controls access to the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Dunder methods (short for double underscore methods) in Python are special methods with names like __init__ and __str__.\n",
        "\n",
        "  In short: They let you define how objects behave with built-in operations (like creation, printing, or using operators).\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  * __init__ → runs when an object is created\n",
        "  * __str__ → controls what print(object) shows\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "  - Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a concept where a child class acquires the properties and methods of a parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  In short: It allows one class to reuse and extend another class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example: If Car is a parent class, ElectricCar can inherit from it and add new features.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) means “many forms.”\n",
        "\n",
        "  In short: It allows the same method or operation to behave differently for different objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example: A method called sound():\n",
        "  * A Dog object makes a bark\n",
        "  * A Cat object makes a meow\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by controlling access to data inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  In short:\n",
        "  * Keep variables inside a class\n",
        "  * Restrict direct access using naming conventions\n",
        "\n",
        "  How Python Does It\n",
        "  * Public: variable\n",
        "  * Protected: _variable (shouldn't be accessed directly)\n",
        "  * Private: __variable (name mangling)\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  class Student:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, marks):\n",
        "        self.__marks = marks   # private variable\n",
        "\n",
        "    def get_marks(self):\n",
        "        return self.__marks\n",
        "  Here, __marks can only be accessed through the method, which protects the data.\n",
        "  Encapsulation = data hiding + controlled access\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "  - A constructor in Python is a special method that runs automatically when an object is created from a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  In short: It is used to initialize (set up) object data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Key Point:\n",
        "  * The constructor is named __init__\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Student:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "        self.age = age\n",
        "  When you create an object, the constructor assigns values:\n",
        "\n",
        "  s1 = Student(\"Alex\", 15)\n",
        "  Here, __init__ sets the initial state of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, class methods and static methods are special methods inside a class, but they behave differently from regular instance methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Class Method :\n",
        "  * Defined with the @classmethod decorator\n",
        "  * Takes cls as the first parameter (refers to the class itself)\n",
        "  * Can access/modify class-level data, not instance-level data\n",
        "  class Student:\n",
        "    school = \"ABC School\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    @classmethod\n",
        "    def get_school(cls):\n",
        "        return cls.school\n",
        "\n",
        "  print(Student.get_school())  # Output: ABC School\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Static Method :\n",
        "  * Defined with the @staticmethod decorator\n",
        "  * Doesn't take self or cls as a parameter\n",
        "  * Acts like a regular function inside the class\n",
        "  * Cannot access instance or class variables unless explicitly passed\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  class Math:\n",
        "    @staticmethod\n",
        "    def add(a, b):\n",
        "        return a + b\n",
        "\n",
        "  print(Math.add(5, 3))  # Output: 8\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "  - Method overloading is the ability to create multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in a class.\n",
        "  class Math:\n",
        "    def add(self, a, b=0):\n",
        "        return a + b\n",
        "  m = Math()\n",
        "  print(m.add(5))     # Output: 5\n",
        "  print(m.add(5, 3))  # Output: 8\n",
        "\n",
        "  Here, the add method works for one or two arguments, simulating method overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "  - Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) occurs when a child class provides its own version of a method that is already defined in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Animal:\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Some generic sound\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def sound(self):  # Overriding the parent method\n",
        "        print(\"Bark\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  a = Animal()\n",
        "  a.sound()  # Output: Some generic sound\n",
        "\n",
        "  d = Dog()\n",
        "  d.sound()  # Output: Bark\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, a property decorator (@property) is used to turn a method into a “getter” for an attribute, allowing you to access it like a regular variable instead of calling a method.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  class Student:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "        self._name = name  # private variable\n",
        "\n",
        "    @property\n",
        "    def name(self):\n",
        "        return self._name  # getter method\n",
        "\n",
        "  s = Student(\"Alex\")\n",
        "  print(s.name)  # Access like a variable, Output: Alex\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism is important in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it allows different objects to be treated in a uniform way, even if they behave differently.\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Animal:\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        pass\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Bark\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Meow\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  animals = [Dog(), Cat()]\n",
        "  for animal in animals:\n",
        "    animal.sound()  # Works for all objects\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Here, the same method call (sound()) behaves differently for each object, demonstrating polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be a blueprint for other classes. It can define abstract methods that must be implemented by its child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Animal(ABC):\n",
        "    @abstractmethod\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        pass  # Must be implemented by subclasses\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Bark\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  d = Dog()\n",
        "  d.sound()  # Output: Bark\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Abstract classes define a template for other classes, enforcing that certain methods are implemented.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages over procedural programming. It makes code organized, reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Key Advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1.Modularity : Code is organized into classes and objects, making it easier to manage.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2.Reusability : Classes can be reused in other programs via inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3.Maintainability : Encapsulation and modularity make code easier to debug and update.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4.Flexibility : Polymorphism allows the same interface to work with different objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "  5.Real-world Modeling : Objects and classes mimic real-world entities, making design intuitive.\n",
        "\n",
        "  6.Security : Encapsulation protects data from unauthorized access.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "  - In Python OOP, the difference between class variables and instance variables is about where the data is stored and shared.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Class Variable\n",
        "  * Shared by all objects of the class\n",
        "  * Defined inside the class but outside any methods\n",
        "  * Changes affect all instances\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  class Student:\n",
        "    school = \"ABC School\"  # class variable\n",
        "\n",
        "  s1 = Student()\n",
        "  s2 = Student()\n",
        "  print(s1.school)  # ABC School\n",
        "  print(s2.school)  # ABC School\n",
        "\n",
        "  Student.school = \"XYZ School\"\n",
        "  print(s1.school)  # XYZ School\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Instance Variable\n",
        "  * Unique to each object\n",
        "  * Defined inside a method, usually __init__\n",
        "  * Changes affect only that instance\n",
        "\n",
        " Example:\n",
        " class Student:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "        self.name = name  # instance variable\n",
        "\n",
        "  s1 = Student(\"Alex\")\n",
        "  s2 = Student(\"Brian\")\n",
        "  print(s1.name)  # Alex\n",
        "  print(s2.name)  # Brian\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "  - Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature where a child class can inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Father:\n",
        "    def skills(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Gardening\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Mother:\n",
        "    def skills(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Cooking\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Child(Father, Mother):\n",
        "    pass\n",
        "\n",
        "  c = Child()\n",
        "  c.skills()  # Output: Gardening\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ''__str__' and '__repr__'' methods in Python.\n",
        "  - In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are dunder (special) methods used to represent objects as strings, but they serve different purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. __str__ :\n",
        "  * Provides a readable, user-friendly string of the object\n",
        "  * Called by print() or str()\n",
        "  * Meant for end users\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Student:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "        self.age = age\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __str__(self):\n",
        "        return f\"Student Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  s = Student(\"Alex\", 15)\n",
        "  print(s)  # Output: Student Name: Alex, Age: 15\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. __repr__ :\n",
        "  * Provides an unambiguous, developer-friendly string\n",
        "  * Called by repr() or in the interactive console\n",
        "  * Meant for debugging\n",
        "  * Ideally, the string should be able to recreate the object\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Student:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "        self.age = age\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __repr__(self):\n",
        "        return f\"Student('{self.name}', {self.age})\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  s = Student(\"Alex\", 15)\n",
        "  s  # Output: Student('Alex', 15)\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the 'super()' function in Python.\n",
        "  - The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent (base) class in a child (derived) class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Parent:\n",
        "    def greet(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Hello from Parent\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Child(Parent):\n",
        "    def greet(self):\n",
        "        super().greet()  # Call parent method\n",
        "        print(\"Hello from Child\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  c = Child()\n",
        "  c.greet()\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Output:\n",
        "  Hello from Parent\n",
        "  Hello from Child\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The __del__ method in Python is a special destructor method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "  class FileHandler:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, filename):\n",
        "        self.file = open(filename, 'w')\n",
        "        print(\"File opened\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __del__(self):\n",
        "        self.file.close()\n",
        "        print(\"File closed\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  f = FileHandler(\"test.txt\")\n",
        "  del f  # Triggers __del__ method\n",
        "\n",
        "  Key Points:\n",
        "  * Called automatically when an object's reference count drops to zero\n",
        "  * Useful for cleanup tasks\n",
        "  * Avoid relying too much on __del__ for critical tasks, as timing of destruction is not guaranteed\n",
        "  * __del__ = destructor, cleans up before an object is destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define special types of methods inside a class, but they behave differently.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. @staticmethod\n",
        "  * Does not take self or cls as a parameter\n",
        "  * Cannot access instance variables or class variables directly\n",
        "  * Acts like a regular function inside a class\n",
        "  * Used for utility functions related to the class\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. @classmethod\n",
        "  * Takes cls as the first parameter (refers to the class)\n",
        "  * Can access and modify class variables\n",
        "  * Can also be used as factory methods\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "  - In Python, polymorphism with inheritance allows a child class to provide a different implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class. This lets you treat objects of different classes uniformly while calling the same method name.\n",
        "\n",
        "  How it Works:\n",
        "  * A parent class defines a method.\n",
        "  * A child class overrides that method with its own behavior.\n",
        "  * You can call the method on any object (parent or child), and the appropriate version is executed.\n",
        "  * This is often combined with inheritance and supports runtime polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "  class Animal:\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Some generic sound\")\n",
