        "1. what is python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   - Python is a high-level programming language that is designed to be easy to read, easy to write, and very versatile.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Python is popular because it combines simplicity, power, and a huge community, making it useful for beginners and experts.\n",
        "     Here are the main reasons: * Very Easy to Learn and Read\n",
        "                                * Extremely Versatile\n",
        "                                * Huge, Supportive Community\n",
        "                                * Used by Big Tech and Industry\n",
        "                                * Massive Library and Framework Ecosystem\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "   - In Python, an interpreter is the program that reads and executes Python code line by line.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "   - Pre-defined keywords in Python are special, reserved words that have fixed meanings in the language.\n",
        "   We cannot use them as variable names, function names, or identifiers because Python uses them to define its syntax and structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "   - No — Python keywords cannot be used as variable names.\n",
        "     Keywords have special meanings in Python’s syntax.\n",
        "     Using them as variable names would confuse the interpreter.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "   - Mutability in Python refers to whether an object’s value can be changed after it is created.\n",
        "   Mutable Objects: These can be changed in place without creating a new object.\n",
        "   Common mutable types: list,dict,set,bytearray.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "   - Lists are mutable and tuples are immutable because of how they are         designed and stored in memory in Python. Their behavior reflects different purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "   Lists → Meant for change\n",
        "   Lists are built for situations where items need to be added, removed, or modified.\n",
        "   So Python stores them in a flexible structure that allows updating elements.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Tuples → Meant for fixed collections\n",
        "   Tuples represent sequences that should not change: constants\n",
        "   fixed records (e.g., coordinates, database rows)\n",
        "   keys in dictionaries (because immutability = hashable)\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "   - == checks whether two objects have the same value/content.\n",
        "     \n",
        "     is checks whether two variables refer to the exact same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "   - Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements and return Boolean values (True or False). They are essential in decision-making and controlling program flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "   - Type casting in Python is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another.\n",
        "   Types of type casting: * Implicit type casting\n",
        "                          * Explicit type casting\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "    - Implicit Type Casting Performed automatically by Python.It is also called type promotion usually occurs in numeric operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Explicit Type Casting Performed manually by the programmer.It uses built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), list(), etc.It required when Python cannot automatically convert the type.          \n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "    - Conditional statements in Python are used to execute code only if certain conditions are true. They allow programs to make decisions and control the flow of execution based on different situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "    - The elif statement in Python stands for “else if”. It is used to check multiple conditions sequentially after an initial if statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "     How elif works : Python evaluates the if condition first.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the if condition is True, its block runs and the rest (elif/else) is skipped.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the if condition is False, Python checks the elif condition(s) in order.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first elif that is True executes its block, and the rest are skipped.\n",
        "\n",
        "If none of the conditions are True, the else block (if present) executes.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "    - for loop : Used when the number of iterations is known or you are        iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).\n",
        "     Iterates over each element of the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "     While loop : Used when the number of iterations is unknown, and you want to repeat as long as a condition is True.The loop continues until the condition becomes False.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.?\n",
        "    - A while loop is more suitable than a for loop when you don’t know in advance how many times you need to repeat a block of code, and the repetition depends on a dynamic condition rather than a fixed sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Suppose you want to ask a user to enter a password, and you want to keep asking until the user enters the correct password.\n",
        "     You don’t know how many attempts it will take in advance, so a while loop is perfect.\n",
        "    \n",
        "     correct_password = \"python123\"\n",
        "\n",
        "     user_input = \"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "     while user_input != correct_password:\n",
        "\n",
        "           user_input = input(\"Enter your password: \")\n",
        "\n",
        "     print(\"Access granted!\")\n",
        "     \n",
        "Explanation: The loop continues until the user enters the correct password.\n",
        "\n",
        "             We don’t know beforehand how many attempts the user will take.\n",
        "\n",
        "             A for loop would be less suitable because it’s designed for fixed iterations.\n",
