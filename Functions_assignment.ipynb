        "  - In Python, generators are a special kind of iterable that allow you to produce values one at a time, on demand, instead of creating and storing all values in memory at once.They are especially useful for large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "  What Is a Generator?\n",

        "  * Implements the iterator protocol automatically\n",
        "  * Can be iterated over only once\n",
        "\n",
        "  How Generators Are Defined:\n",
        "  1. Generator Functions (using yield) : A function becomes a generator when it uses the yield keyword instead of return.\n",

        "  def count_up(n):\n",
        "      for i in range(1, n + 1):\n",
        "          yield i\n",
        "\n",
        "  Calling the function does not run it immediately—it returns a generator object.\n",
        "\n",
        "  gen = count_up(3)\n",
        "\n",
        "  print(next(gen))  # 1\n",
        "  print(next(gen))  # 2\n",
        "  print(next(gen))  # 3\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Generator Expressions : A compact, one-line way to create generators (similar to list comprehensions).\n",

        "  squares = (x * x for x in range(5))\n",
        "\n",
        "  for s in squares:\n",
        "      print(s)\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "  - Using generators instead of regular functions (that return full collections like lists) has several important advantages in Python, especially when working with large or streamed data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Advantages of Generators-\n",
        "  1. Memory Efficiency : Generators produce values one at a time, instead of storing all results in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "  # List version (stores all values)\n",
        "  numbers = [x * x for x in range(1_000_000)]\n",
        "\n",
        "  # Generator version (creates values on demand)\n",
        "  numbers = (x * x for x in range(1_000_000))\n",
        "\n",
        "  ✔ Much lower memory usage with generators\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Lazy Evaluation : Values are generated only when needed, which can save time and resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "  def countdown(n):\n",
        "      while n > 0:\n",
        "          yield n\n",
        "          n -= 1\n",
        "\n",
        "  The function runs step by step, not all at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Better Performance for Large or Infinite Data\n",
        "\n",
        "  Generators are ideal for:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Large datasets\n",
        "  * Streams (files, network data)\n",
        "  * Infinite sequences\n",

        "          yield n\n",
        "          n += 1\n",
        "\n",
        "  A list cannot handle this safely.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Cleaner and Simpler Code : Generators often replace complex loops and temporary lists with shorter, clearer code.\n",
        "\n",
        "  # Without generator\n",
