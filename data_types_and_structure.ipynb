        "  1. Mutability (Most Important Difference)\n",
        "  Lists — Mutable\n",

        "  * Tuples can be dictionary keys (if they contain only immutable elements).\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "4. Describe how dictionaries store data?\n",
        "  - A dictionary stores data as key-value pairs, where each unique key is associated with a value.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Here's how dictionaries store and manage data internally:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Key-Value Structure\n",
        "\n",
        "  Each entry consists of:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Key: unique identifier (e.g., \"name\", 42)\n",
        "\n",
        "  Value: data associated with the key (e.g., \"Alice\", 100)\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "  {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Hashing Mechanism :-\n",
        "  \n",
        "  * Dictionaries use a hash function to convert a key into a hash code (a number).\n",
        "\n",
        "  * This hash code determines where the key–value pair is stored in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Because of hashing, lookup, insertion, and deletion are typically very fast (O(1) average time).\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Storage in Buckets\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Memory is divided into buckets (slots).\n",
        "\n",
        "  * The hash code points to a specific bucket where the value is stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * The key is stored along with the value to ensure correctness.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Handling Collisions\n",
        "\n",
        "  * A collision occurs when two different keys produce the same hash.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Dictionaries handle collisions using techniques such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Chaining: storing multiple key-value pairs in the same bucket (e.g., via a list)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Open addressing: finding another empty bucket using a probing method\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. Dynamic Resizing\n",
        "\n",
        "  * When the dictionary becomes too full, it resizes (allocates more buckets).\n",
        "\n",
        "  * All existing keys are rehashed and redistributed to maintain performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Unordered (Logically)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Dictionaries do not rely on index positions like lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Modern languages (e.g., Python 3.7+) preserve insertion order, but this is an implementation detail, not the fundamental storage principle.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "  - You might use a set instead of a list in Python when you care about uniqueness, speed, or set-based operations rather than order or indexing.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Key reasons to use a set instead of a list :\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Automatic uniqueness\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Sets store only unique elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Duplicate values are automatically removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "  nums = [1, 2, 2, 3]\n",
        "  set(nums)   # {1, 2, 3}\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Efficient set operations\n",
        "\n",
        "  Sets support mathematical operations like:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Union (|)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Intersection (&)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Difference (-)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Symmetric difference (^)\n",
        "\n",
        "  a & b   # common elements\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Removing duplicates efficiently\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Converting a list to a set is the fastest way to eliminate duplicates.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * When order doesn't matter\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Sets are unordered, so they're ideal when you don't need indexing or element positions.\n",
        "\n",
        "  When NOT to use a set:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * You need ordered elements\n",
        "\n",
        "  * You need index-based access\n",
        "\n",
        "  * You want to allow duplicate values\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "  - A string in Python is a sequence of characters used to represent text, while a list is a sequence of elements that can store items of any data type.\n",
        "\n",
        "  What is a string?\n",
        "\n",
        "  A string is written using quotes:\n",
        "\n",

        "  'Python'\n",
        "\n",
        "  Each character has an index:\n",
        "\n",
        "  s = \"Hi\"\n",
        "  s[0]  # 'H'\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "  What is a list?\n",
        "\n",
        "  * A list is written using square brackets:\n",
        "\n",
        "  [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "  [\"a\", 5, True]\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Lists can contain mixed data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Lists are mutable, meaning you can change, add, or remove elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "  - Tuples help ensure data integrity in Python primarily through immutability.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Key ways tuples ensure data integrity\n",
        "\n",
        "  Immutability:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "  * Coordinates (x, y)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * RGB color values (255, 0, 0)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Database records\n",
        "\n",
        "  * This guarantees the relationship between values stays intact.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Hashable (when contents are immutable):\n",
        "\n",
        " * Tuples can be used as dictionary keys or set elements (if they contain only immutable items).\n",
        "\n",
        " * This ensures consistent lookup behavior and prevents key corruption.\n",
        "\n",
        " Thread safety (basic level):\n",
        "\n",
        " * Because tuples cannot change, they are safer to share across different parts of a program without synchronization.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "  - A hash table is a data structure that stores data in a way that allows fast insertion, lookup, and deletion, typically in O(1) average time.\n",

        "  - Dictionaries offer several advantages over lists for specific tasks, mainly because they store key-value pairs instead of just indexed elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Fast lookup by key\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Accessing an element in a dictionary by its key is O(1) on average, thanks to hashing.\n",

        "\n",
        "  Tuples are immutable, meaning once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be changed. This design choice helps ensure data integrity and allows tuples to be used safely in places where constant data is required.\n",

        "   Average-case time complexity: O(1)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Dictionary lookups (e.g., my_dict[key]) take constant time on average.\n",

        "  * This is because dictionaries are implemented using a hash table.\n",

        "  - Lists are preferred over dictionaries when your data is ordered, sequential, or index-based, and you don't need key-value mapping.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data    retrieval?\n",
        "  - Traditionally, dictionaries are described as unordered because they are implemented as hash tables, not as sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Why dictionaries are considered unordered :\n",

        "\n",
        "  * There is no logical or positional relationship between keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * You cannot reliably access an item by “position” like dict[0].\n",
